<title>Install information</title>
<para>
The install process in Windows is a simple task. 
One executable file contains all packed data (executables, documentation, files, sources, etc.) that must be installed. 
To be able to control its internal state, Windows keeps a lot of information in the called <emphasis>register</emphasis>. 
Some Windows users are restrictive about softwares or tools writing or changing information on register. 
So, the Qgar install does not write any information on it. 
As a drawback, the only automatic way to remove Qgar is executing its uninstall. 
Meanwhile it's possible to remove all files by hand without breaking any <emphasis>register</emphasis> consistence.
</para>

<para>
The installer creates a shortcut path called <emphasis> Qgar </emphasis> inside the <emphasis> Programs </emphasis> menu. 
It contains also a shortcut to a <emphasis>command window</emphasis> in Qgar directory, a shortcut to the installed documentation, a
shortcut to <emphasis>Qgar Graphics User Interface</emphasis> and a shortcut to the <emphasis>Uninstaller</emphasis>.
</para>
<sect2 id="Details">
  <title>Install details</title>
  <para>
  The installer will <emphasis>not</emphasis> look for the Windows default program files directory. Due to
constraints in the actual XML parser model of Qgar, directories with empty spaces are not recognized. If Qgar 
is installed in such conditions, no algorithms will be available inside the interface. 
  </para>
  <para>
  The <emphasis>qgar</emphasis> directory will be proposed as default directory after the installer look for the default drive, which 
  is in most of cases the <emphasis>C:</emphasis> drive. 
  However, no constraint is imposed by the installer. Any drive of directory name can be used since they <emphasis>don't</emphasis> have empty spaces.

        Qgar is distributed under two licenses, que LGPL and the QPL. 
	The QPL is the open source license and it's necessary due to QgarGUI graphical interface, built using the Qt library. 
	It's mandatory to accept both licenses, otherwise the install process will stop.

        The default install directory is automaticaly determined by the installer, based on default Windows applications driver.

	It can be changed to any directory the user has rights to write, keeping in mind the white spaced directories contraint.

    <title>Uninstalling Qgar Software</title>
    <para>
    The <emphasis>Uninstaller</emphasis> is an executable file located in Qgar directory. 
    It can be deleted as any other file by any user with enough rights. 
    Once removed, the uninstall process cannot be done automaticaly anymore. 
    However, few steps are enough to totaly remove Qgar Software withou the <emphasis>Uninstaller</emphasis>  as it does not make any changes in Windows registry.
    </para>

    <para>
    To remove it by hand, is enough to remove the Qgar directory created by the <emphasis>Install</emphasis> process. 
    The last pass, is to remove the Qgar entry in <emphasis>Programs</emphasis> menu.
    </para>

<sect2 id="StepByStepUninst">
  <title>Step-by-step uninstall</title>
    <para>
      The process of uninstall the Qgar Software is simpler than the installer one. 
      The <emphasis>Uninstaller</emphasis> has internaly all information done by the <emphasis>Installer</emphasis> once they are built by the same script. 
      The process consists in removing all Qgar directory contents, the directory itself (if it is empty!) and the shortcuts previously created in <emphasis>Start Menu</emphasis>.
    </para>
    <para>
      To execute it is enough to chose the <emphasis>Unistall</emphasis> option in Qgar tab in <emphasis>Start Menu</emphasis> or directly execute the unistaller file located in the directory where the Qgar Software was installed.

      Graphics recognition is a multi-disciplinary domain,
      involving techniques as heterogeneous as signal processing, image processing,
      pattern recognition, or computer vision. A research team working in the domain
      cannot start an application from scratch. It must be able to reuse whole or part
      of software implemented for previous work, as well as experience collected at
      these occasions. The working base built up in this way allows research projects
      to be efficiently conducted, by reusing existing material, standardizing program
      coding, and making ideas and software exchanges easier.

      For several years, the <ulink url="http://www.loria.fr/equipes/qgar/">Qgar Research Team</ulink> at 
      <ulink url="http://www.loria.fr">LORIA</ulink> has devoted much effort to the construction of such a 
      software environment 
      <ulink url="../../html/bibliography/bibliography.html">[Tombre et al, 1998]</ulink> 
      <ulink url="../../html/bibliography/bibliography.html">[Dosch et al, 2000]</ulink>

	  QgarLib is a library of C++ classes implementing basic graphics analysis and recognition methods.

          <simpara>
	  QgarApps is an applicative layer, including higher-level applications (binarization, edge detection, 
	  text-graphics separation, thick-thin separation, vectorization...). A third-party application, either 
	  designed apart from the Qgar software or not, can be integrated into the system by wrapping it with a 
	  predefined C++ class, without recompiling any part of the system itself <ulink url="../../html/bibliography/bibliography.html">[Rendek et al, 2004b]</ulink>.

	  QgarGui is a graphical interface to design and run applications, provided with data manipulation and display capabilities.

      This environmnet has been used within the frame of several projects, in particular DocMining, supported by the French national 
      program for software technologies <ulink url="../../html/bibliography/bibliography.html">[Clavier et al, 2004]</ulink>.

      Qgar is a registered trademark of <ulink url="http://www.inria.fr">INRIA</ulink>, and the Qgar environment is registered as 
      free software by the French agency for software protection, according to the terms of two licenses:

      The Qgar software is entirely developed in C++, for Unix/Linux OS. The source code includes about 50,000 lines and may 
      be freely downloaded, together with its installation/compilation tools as well as the HTML version of the documentation, 
      from the Qgar software web site See button '<emphasis>Downloads</emphasis>' in the menu on the left. A click on the Qgar logo makes you go 
      to the Qgar software web site.
